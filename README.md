> Sudden drop from season 7 to season 8 is likely caused by Michael leaving The Office

### Which episodes had the highest and lowest IMDb ratings?

```The slope of the line of best fit is -0.004078```


_*Season 7 Goodbye Michael - As the office gets ready for Michael's final day at Dunder Mifflin, Michael doesn't tell anyone that he's leaving a day early. Meanwhile, Deangelo accompanies a nervous Andy on a visit to one of Michael's old clients._

_*Season 8 Get the Girl - Andy goes to Tallahassee to tell Erin that he loves her and needs her to return to Scranton. Meanwhile, Nellie shows up in Scranton and tries to claim Andy's manager position by offering everyone raises._



> In this scenario, the slope of the line of best fit represents the trend of IMDb ratings across the episodes in the dataset. Specifically, the slope indicates the average change in IMDb ratings per episode.

> If the slope is positive, it suggests that, on average, IMDb ratings tend to increase as the episodes progress. Conversely, if the slope is negative, it indicates that IMDb ratings generally decrease as the episodes progress. If the slope is close to zero, it means that there's no strong trend in either direction, and the ratings remain relatively stable throughout the episodes.



### Which episodes had the highest and lowest viewership?

```The slope of the line of best fit is -0.022977```


_*Season 5 Stress Relief - Dwight's too-realistic fire alarm gives Stanley a heart attack. When he returns, Michael learns that he is the cause of Stanley's stress. To remedy the situation, he forces the office to throw a roast for him._

_*Season 9 Paper Airplane - The employees hold a paper airplane competition, Andy gets an acting role in a workplace safety video, and Jim and Pam's marriage tensions continue to build._

> Stress Relief had a large increase in viewership likely due to iconic scenes such as the "Fire Drill" and "First Aid Fail/Staying Alive CPR"

### How Does viewership correlate with IMDb ratings?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128242031/226139194-02285a60-9966-4125-8ea1-f950041ed6f3.png)

> A correlation coefficient of 0.49 indicates a moderate positive relationship between the two variables. In this case, it means that as the viewership of an episode increases, the IMDb rating of that episode is also likely to increase, but the relationship is not extremely strong.

> To put it simply, higher viewership episodes tend to have higher IMDb ratings, but there are other factors that may influence the ratings as well, and the relationship is not so strong that it would be accurate to predict IMDb ratings solely based on viewership.


### Are there any specific patterns or trends in episode themes (based on the "About" column) that are associated with higher ratings or viewership?

Use Latent Dirichlet Allocation

>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to discover hidden topics within a collection of documents or text data. It assumes that documents are made up of a mixture of topics, and each topic is a combination of words with certain probabilities.

Here's a high-level explanation of what LDA does with the data:

1) The algorithm starts by randomly assigning each word in the documents to one of the pre-defined number of topics. At this stage, the topic assignment may not make much sense.

2) Next, it iteratively refines these topic assignments by looking at two factors:
a) How often a word appears in a topic across all documents.
b) How often a topic appears in a document.

3) The algorithm repeats this process many times, updating the topic assignments for words in the documents based on the factors above. Over time, the topics begin to take shape, and words that frequently co-occur start to cluster together in topics.

4) Once the algorithm converges, you are left with a set of topics, each represented by a group of words with associated probabilities. You can then use these topics to understand the underlying themes or patterns present in the documents.

In summary, LDA helps uncover hidden patterns (topics) in text data by looking at the co-occurrence of words within documents and identifying groups of words that frequently appear together.

```
Topic: 0 
Words: 0.026*"andy" + 0.020*"michael" + 0.019*"dwight" + 0.019*"office" + 0.014*"tries" + 0.012*"jim" + 0.011*"pam" + 0.010*"meanwhile" + 0.008*"party" + 0.008*"robert"

Topic: 1 
Words: 0.036*"michael" + 0.023*"dwight" + 0.018*"andy" + 0.014*"pam" + 0.014*"jim" + 0.013*"party" + 0.013*"new" + 0.013*"dunder" + 0.013*"mifflin" + 0.011*"angela"

Topic: 2 
Words: 0.035*"michael" + 0.029*"office" + 0.020*"dwight" + 0.014*"jim" + 0.014*"tries" + 0.014*"meanwhile" + 0.011*"Å¡Ã£" + 0.008*"gets" + 0.008*"pam" + 0.008*"andy"

Topic: 3 
Words: 0.034*"michael" + 0.026*"jim" + 0.016*"dwight" + 0.016*"pam" + 0.016*"office" + 0.013*"mifflin" + 0.013*"dunder" + 0.012*"andy" + 0.011*"new" + 0.009*"day"

Topic: 4 
Words: 0.029*"michael" + 0.026*"jim" + 0.023*"pam" + 0.023*"dwight" + 0.016*"office" + 0.011*"baby" + 0.011*"andy" + 0.010*"mifflin" + 0.010*"dunder" + 0.009*"tries"
```

These outputs represent the top 10 keywords for each topic generated by the LDA model. Each topic is a mixture of keywords with associated probabilities (weights). The higher the probability of a keyword in a topic, the more important the keyword is in defining that topic.

Here's a simplified interpretation of the topics based on the keywords:

1) Topic 0: This topic seems to revolve around Andy, Michael, Dwight, and the office environment. It also includes themes like trying something, parties, and interactions with Robert.
2) Topic 1: This topic is more focused on Michael, Dwight, Andy, Pam, and Jim, as well as parties, and Dunder Mifflin as a company. It also includes Angela as a character.
3) Topic 2: In this topic, Michael, the office, Dwight, and Jim are prominent. It seems to include situations where someone is trying something and interactions with other characters.
4) Topic 3: This topic is centered around Michael, Jim, Dwight, Pam, and the office, along with Dunder Mifflin as a company. It also involves themes related to new things or experiences and daily activities.
5) Topic 4: The main characters in this topic are Michael, Jim, Pam, and Dwight. The office environment and Dunder Mifflin are also present. It introduces themes like babies and trying something.

Keep in mind that LDA topics are not explicitly defined, and their interpretation is based on the keywords that have the highest probabilities within each topic. The simplified interpretation provided above is based on the assumption that the main characters and their interactions are the primary drivers of the topics.

### Use the sentiment analysis tool to determine if episodes with positive or negative sentiment in the summaries have an impact on ratings or viewership?

1) We used a tool called "SentimentIntensityAnalyzer" from nltk to measure the sentiment of the episode summaries. Sentiment is a way to determine if the text has a positive, negative, or neutral tone.

2) We created two scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the sentiment scores and IMDb ratings, and between sentiment scores and viewership. This helps us see if there is any connection between the tone of the episode summaries and their ratings or viewership.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128242031/226140659-ec468a4f-92da-4185-ba40-107fcb032da9.png)

3) We calculated the correlation coefficients to measure the strength of the relationship between sentiment scores and IMDb ratings, as well as sentiment scores and viewership. A correlation coefficient is a number between -1 and 1 that indicates how closely related two variables are.

```
Correlation between sentiment scores and IMDb ratings: -0.11642027169707882
Correlation between sentiment scores and viewership: -0.1013892861047804
```

These correlation coefficients tell us about the relationship between sentiment scores and IMDb ratings, and sentiment scores and viewership.

1) Correlation between sentiment scores and IMDb ratings: -0.116
This negative correlation coefficient indicates that there is a very weak negative relationship between sentiment scores and IMDb ratings. This means that when the sentiment score is higher (more positive), the IMDb ratings tend to be slightly lower, and vice versa. However, the relationship is very weak, so it's not a strong or reliable predictor.

2) Correlation between sentiment scores and viewership: -0.101
This negative correlation coefficient also indicates a very weak negative relationship between sentiment scores and viewership. This means that when the sentiment score is higher (more positive), the viewership tends to be slightly lower, and vice versa. But again, the relationship is very weak, so it's not a strong or reliable predictor.

In both cases, the correlation coefficients are close to 0, which means there is **little to no relationship between the variables**. In simpler terms, the sentiment scores of the episode summaries don't seem to have a significant impact on either the IMDb ratings or the viewership of the episodes.
